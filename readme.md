# unixtime.app - Bulk Timestamp Conversion for API developers
## An App for unix timestamp conversion when working with API responses.

A unix epoch timestamp conversion tool to convert and highlight full texts, whole API responses, and lists with timestamps. Everything that looks like a timestamp since a specific year will just be replaced - simple and easy.

Configuration Options are available: Chose between milliseconds and seconds and choose the year for the timestamps.

This App works for a list of timestamps, complete API responses, and whatever text you provide.

Feedback is welcome..
