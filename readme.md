# unixtime.app - fulltext timestamp conversion

## No more tedious searching for the timestamps. Just give everything to the tool and get the already converted results as highlight.


A unix epoch timestamp conversion tool to convert and highlight complete texts, whole API responses and lists with timestampsEverything that looks like a timestamp since a certain year will just be replaced - simple and easy.

Configuration Options are vailable: Chose between milliseconds and seconds and define the year since when timestamps should be converted.

Works for a list of timestamps, but also full api responses and whatever text you provide.

Feedback is welcome.
