# unixtime.app - Bulk Timestamp Conversion for API Developers

Welcome to `unixtime.app`, a dedicated tool designed to streamline the timestamp conversion process for API developers. This application is an ideal solution for converting and highlighting unix epoch timestamps within full texts, complete API responses, and lists containing timestamps.

## Key Features

- **Bulk Conversion**: Effortlessly convert entire texts, API responses, and lists with timestamps.
- **Automatic Detection**: The app identifies and converts anything that resembles a unix timestamp since a specific year.
- **Simple Replacement**: Timestamps are replaced directly in the text, offering a seamless conversion experience.

## Configuration Options

- **Epoch Format**: Choose between milliseconds and seconds for timestamp representation.
- **Year Threshold**: Specify the starting year for recognizing timestamps.

## Use Cases

- **API Response Handling**: Perfect for developers working with APIs that return timestamps.
- **Timestamp Lists**: Convert lists of timestamps with ease.
- **Text Processing**: Useful for processing any text that includes unix timestamps.

## Getting Started
