convert unixtimestamps in text

On another note / maybe helpful for you as well: I saw the need for easier timestamp conversion and created a side project in my own time to debug timestamps since I was tired of all the selecting, copy and pasting.
I moved it to its own domain for easier access: <https://www.unixtime.app>
It simply does a full text replacements for whatever input you provide of [millis or seconds] timestamps, since [whatever year you want, by default 2022] and highlights the changes.
Works for a list of timestamps, but also full api responses.
No data ist stored nowhere, it is just a static index.html, you can have alook at the sourcecode. :zwinkern:
Feedback is welcome.
