                an API
                developer's workflow.</h1>
            <p> Hi, Iam Klaus Breyer. And I am the author of unixtime.app: An
                API
                developers
                tool for bulk timestamp conversion.</p>
            <p>
                Here I want to tell the story of how I scratched my own itch and
                how
                this turned
                into a product.</p>
            <h2>Context: IIotT (Industrial Internet of Things)</h2>
            <p>
                The idea's genesis happened during my current stint as Tech Lead
                for
                a
                front-end-heavy product in an IIoT microservice context.

                As you might assume, data in the IIoT environment has a lot of
                timestamps. In
                the ecosystem I currently work for, the dates were unfortunately
                not
                encoded as
                ISO but as Unix timestamps in milliseconds.</p>
            <p>
                At one point, a completely new microservice was written - we
                were
                supposed to be
                the first customers and could help with requirements.</p>
            <p>
                So far, so good - but then, at some point, the time came when my
                team and I
                needed to test and implement the new service.

                And then the fun began: I looked at API responses for hours and
                days, wondering
                whether the API was doing something wrong or our own code. So,
                nothing unusual.
                A typical step during development in systems with high real-time
                requirements.</p>
            <h2> Personal Workflow - before</h2>
            <p> I am a heavy user of Postman. I usually create or import all the
                API
                endpoints a
                product consumes.

                To verify that the new service is working, I triggered the
                requests
                and looked
                at the responses to check them. Sometimes, I copied browser
                requests
                as curl and
                pasted them into Postman to debug them there.</p>
            <img src="./story/postman-old-workflow.png" />

            <ul>
                <li>In both cases, I had to painstakingly select the timestamp
                    with
                    the mouse
                    cursor each time, ensuring I didn't forget a digit.</li>

                <li>Next up: I googled "Unix Timestamp Conversion" (or
                    something
                    similar). There
                    are a lot of pages from the seemingly early 2000s that serve
                    this
                    request. They
                    were either terribly confusing and terrible to use.</li>

                <li>And when I got the result, I had to re-contextualize the
                    API
                    call
                    I was
                    debugging.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Those steps I repeated - a lot, basically, for each API
                response.

                This is incredibly annoying when you only have to check for
                sortings
                and compare
                whether one timestamp comes before or after another!</p>
            <p>
                I often ended up with multiple pages to convert multiple
                timestamps
                in parallel.</p>
            <p>
                This is a super error-prone workflow. Trying to mark timestamps
                precisely with a
                mouse cursor is not just tiring; errors are inevitable when
                comparing multiple
                values.</p>
            <p>
                I also looked in the Mac App Store for solutions to have a
                pretty
                and
                easy-to-use tool installed as an application. But, the Apps in
                the
                Mac App Store
                were obviously not developed by developers who optimize their
                workflow for API
                development.</p>
            <p>
                In my despair, for very complicated cases where I had to process
                whole arrays of
                objects with timestamps, I wrote a small individual script that
                iterated over
                them and made comparisons where necessary.</p>
            <h2>Personal Workflow - after</h2>
            <p>

                Now, I do not select an individual attribute value in Postman
                anymore.

                Instead, I copy & paste the complete API request into my handy
                unixtime.app.
                Here I can see the converted timestamp in the corresponding
                context
                of the API
                call.</p>
            <img src="./story/unixtime.app-workflow.png" />
            <p>
                So I know precisely which timestamp belongs to which ID as they
                are
                highlighted,
                and I can continue debugging without losing context.</p>
            <h2> A new collaborative workflow</h2>
            <p>
                As a nice side-effect, I can use screenshots of the conversions
                for
                collaboration. Because in most cases, however, it wasn't my code
                that was the
                problem (of course!!).

                So I now take screenshots from the unixtime.app and then share
                them
                in Slack
                #support channels or JIRA tickets.</p>
            <img src="./story/slack-support-message.png" />
            <p>
                For creating support cases now, I do not need to copy, paste,
                format, and
                shorten the API responses.

                I also saved myself the burden of copying and pasting precisely
                which timestamp
                was wrong in what context because this is obvious through the
                image.

            <h2>Prototyping Progress</h2>
            <p>
                As a fellow developer, you probably guessed that what this tool
                does
                is no
                rocket science.
            <ul>
                <li>The first version I built in 1h of my free time as a quick
                    proof
                    of concept
                    was just a single HTML file - sharable with my team.</li>

                <li>Next, I moved it to a domain that is easy to remember.</li>

                <li>At some point, I decided to add syntax highlighting for
                    JSON
                    because I guessed
                    this is what most of the payload would be.</li>

                <li>After everything was proven to work, I decided to release
                    the
                    product as a
                    proper application for Mac and Windows.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <blockquote>I wanted to offer an application that lives in the
                "Applications"
                folder to be used in parallel with a browser, editor, and
                Postman, offering an instantaneous
                conversion of unlimited timestamps.</blockquote>
            <p>Now it is up to you. You can try unixtime.app directly on the
                homepage. And if my little tool helped you a little bit, I would
                be happy if
                you would support
                development by downloading the full version from the App Stores.
